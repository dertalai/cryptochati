Cryptochati XChat-plugin

Cryptochati aims to be a secure and easy to use encryption plugin for XChat.
It's inspired (in concept, not code) in Pidgin-Encryption plugin.

Installation:
    1) You must have installed the pycrypto module. If you are under Debian or
    Ubuntu, simply install "python-crypto" package:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-crypto
    
    Otherwise, grab it from http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/
       
    2) Copy the file named "cryptochati.py" in the "~/.xchat2/" directory
    
    3) Create/edit manually the "friends.txt" file into Cryptochati
    configuration directory "~/.xchat2/cryptochati.conf/friends.txt". You'll
    have to create both the "cryptochati.conf" subdirectory and the
    "friends.txt" file if you have never run the plugin before. Add one nick
    per line.

Running:
    The plugin should be autoloaded the next time XChat start. But you can
	launch it manually with the following command (in XChat):
	
	/py load cryptochati.py

XChat commands:
    There are no commands at the moment. You must manually edit configuration
    files.
