Cryptochati XChat-plugin

Cryptochati aims to be a secure and easy to use encryption plugin for XChat.
It's inspired (in concept, not code) in Pidgin-Encryption plugin. Developed
and only tested under GNU/Linux (Ubuntu).

Installation:
    1) You must have installed the pycrypto module. If you are under Debian or
    Ubuntu, simply install "python-crypto" package:
    $ sudo apt-get install python-crypto
    
    Otherwise, grab it from http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/ and install
    it.
       
    2) Copy the file named "cryptochati.py" in the "~/.xchat2/" directory
    
    3) Run (or restart) XChat. The plugin should be loaded automatically.
    
    4) Tell Cryptochati who are your "crypto-friends":
    /FRIEND ADD <nick>
    
    5) Be sure your friend took the same steps and just talk to him/her in a
    dialog window... or simply try it with yourself.

Running:
    The plugin should be autoloaded every time XChat starts. But you can
	launch it manually in the XChat menu, or with this command line:
	/PY LOAD cryptochati.py
    
    You can also restart it with:
    /PY RELOAD cryptochati.py
    
    Or disable it:
    /PY UNLOAD cryptochati.py

XChat commands:
    /FRIEND ADD <nick> - adds <nick> as a trusted friend
    /FRIEND DEL <nick> - deletes <nick> from trusted friends
    /FRIEND LIST - lists current trusted friends
